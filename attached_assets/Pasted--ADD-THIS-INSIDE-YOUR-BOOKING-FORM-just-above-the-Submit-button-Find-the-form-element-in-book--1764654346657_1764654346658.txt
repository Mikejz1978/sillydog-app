✅ ADD THIS INSIDE YOUR BOOKING FORM (just above the Submit button)

Find the <form> element in book.tsx
(usually near the bottom, right above the submit button).

Right before your "Submit", paste this:

<div className="sms-optin mt-4">
  <label className="flex items-start gap-3">
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      required
      className="mt-1 h-4 w-4"
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      I agree to receive SMS messages from SillyDog Pooper Scooper including
      booking confirmations, schedule updates, route reminders, and invoice
      notifications. Message frequency varies. Message & data rates may apply.
      Reply STOP to opt-out, HELP for help.
    </span>
  </label>
</div>

🧩 WHERE EXACTLY TO PUT IT

It belongs between your form fields and the submit button.

Example:

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  {/* name, phone, address, dogs, notes fields here */}

  {/* ⬇️ Insert this right here */}
  <div className="sms-optin mt-4">
    <label className="flex items-start gap-3">
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        required
        className="mt-1 h-4 w-4"
      />
      <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        I agree to receive SMS messages from SillyDog Pooper Scooper including
        booking confirmations, schedule updates, route reminders, and invoice
        notifications. Message frequency varies. Message & data rates may apply.
        Reply STOP to opt-out, HELP for help.
      </span>
    </label>
  </div>
  {/* ⬆️ Insert here */}

  <button type="submit" className="btn btn-primary w-full mt-6">
    Submit Booking Request
  </button>
</form>


Twilio requires:

✔ Mandatory checkbox
✔ Visible SMS consent
✔ Message types
✔ Frequency statement
✔ Opt-out (STOP) & HELP
✔ Message/data rates

This text is exactly correct.

✅ What to do next

Once you paste the code and save:

Go to https://sillydog-app.onrender.com/book

Confirm the checkbox appears.

Tell me: “It’s live.”

Then I will:

📸 Take the official Twilio screenshot
☁️ Host it for you
🔗 Give you the URL to paste into the “Opt-In Image URLs” field

And your Toll-Free Verification will be ready for resubmission.

Just tell me when the checkbox is live and I’ll take care of the rest.
