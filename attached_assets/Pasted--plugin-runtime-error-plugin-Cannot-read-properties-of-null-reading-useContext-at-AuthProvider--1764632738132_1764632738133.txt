[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')
at AuthProvider in client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx

That error means: React hooks (useQueryClient, useState, etc.) are being called outside of a proper React render. With the code you showed:

export function AuthProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);
  ...
}


this happens in two common cases:

AuthProvider is being called like a function instead of used as <AuthProvider>

Or it’s not inside a <QueryClientProvider>.

We’ll fix both in one shot by making sure your top-level structure is correct.

1️⃣ Fix App.tsx — make sure AuthProvider is used as JSX

Open client/src/App.tsx and make sure your App component looks like this pattern:

import React from "react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import { AuthProvider } from "./contexts/AuthContext";
import { RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";  // or whatever you actually use
import { router } from "./router";                  // adjust to your real router import

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <AuthProvider>
          {/* whatever you render now, e.g.: */}
          <RouterProvider router={router} />
          {/* or your routes/components */}
        </AuthProvider>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;


Important:

You should NOT see anything like:

return AuthProvider({ children: <RouterProvider router={router} /> });


If you see that, change it to the JSX version above.

AuthProvider must be used as <AuthProvider> ... </AuthProvider>, never as a plain function call.

If you already create your QueryClient and QueryClientProvider in main.tsx instead of App.tsx, that’s fine — just make sure:

QueryClientProvider is outside AuthProvider

AuthProvider is outside the rest of your app.

So the nesting somewhere should be:

<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
  <BrowserRouter>
    <AuthProvider>
      <AppRoutesOrWhatever />
    </AuthProvider>
  </BrowserRouter>
</QueryClientProvider>

2️⃣ Double-check main.tsx isn’t also calling hooks wrong

Open client/src/main.tsx and make sure it’s only doing the React render, something like:

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// service worker registration is fine down here if you added it
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register("/sw.js")
      .catch((err) => console.error("Service worker registration failed", err));
  });
}


No hooks (useQueryClient, useState, etc.) should be used in this file.
