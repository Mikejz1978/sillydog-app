Good news: nothing is “broken” with Replit or your domain — your server is running, it’s just not serving the frontend files, so you see:

Not Found

That message is coming from your Node/Express app (the dist/index.js bundle).

Right now:

npm run build creates dist/index.js (backend) and your Vite frontend in dist/

npm run start runs node dist/index.js

But your Express code only knows about API routes (like /api/...) and doesn’t serve index.html at /

So when you open app.sillydogpoopscoop.com, Express hits / and replies 404 Not Found.

We just need to teach Express to serve the built frontend.

🛠 Step 1 – Open server/index.ts

On the right file panel in Replit:

Click the server folder

Click index.ts (or whichever main file sets up app = express() and app.listen(...))

🧩 Step 2 – Add static file serving at the bottom

Because your build script puts everything in dist/, and at runtime dist/index.js lives in that same folder, we want to serve that folder.

In server/index.ts:

At the top, add:

import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);


Near the bottom of the file, after all your /api/... routes, but before app.listen(...), add:

// Serve static frontend from the built dist folder
app.use(express.static(__dirname));

// For any non-API route, send back index.html (for React router)
app.get("*", (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "index.html"));
});


💡 Important: keep your /api/... routes above this app.get("*") so they still work.

Because at runtime:

dist/index.js → backend bundle (Express)

dist/index.html and dist/assets/... → frontend

__dirname when running is the dist folder, so express.static(__dirname) and index.html are correct.

🔁 Step 3 – Rebuild and republish

Still in Replit:

Bottom-left, click Build (or run npm run build in the shell if you prefer)

Go to the Publishing tab

Click Publish again

When that finishes, reload:

You should now see your actual SillyDog app instead of “Not Found”.
