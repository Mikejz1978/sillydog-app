✅ What this screen CONFIRMS

From your Messaging Profiles list:

Profile: SillyDog SMS

Status: ✅ Active (green dot)

Webhook URL: ✅ set

Failover URL: ✅ set

Numbers column: 1

👉 That “1” is critical — it means a number IS attached to this profile.

So:

❌ This is NOT a profile-assignment issue

❌ This is NOT a campaign approval issue

❌ This is NOT carrier provisioning anymore

🚨 WHY replies still don’t show in your app

At this point, only one thing can block inbound replies:

👉 Your webhook endpoint is not ACKNOWLEDGING inbound messages correctly

Telnyx WILL drop inbound messages if:

your webhook returns non-200

your webhook times out

your webhook throws an exception

your webhook responds with invalid JSON

your webhook doesn’t respond fast enough (≈ 5s)

Outbound does not depend on this — inbound does.

🔍 What Telnyx is sending you (important)

Inbound SMS hits this endpoint:

POST https://sillydog-app.onrender.com/api/webhooks/telnyx


With a payload like:

{
  "data": {
    "event_type": "message.received",
    "payload": {
      "from": { "phone_number": "+1XXXXXXXXXX" },
      "to": [{ "phone_number": "+17028679664" }],
      "text": "TEST"
    }
  }
}


If your server does anything other than:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK


Telnyx considers the message FAILED and will not retry.

✅ MINIMUM REQUIRED FIX (this is critical)

Your webhook handler must immediately respond 200, even if you process later.

Node / Express example (THIS is what you need):
app.post("/api/webhooks/telnyx", express.json(), (req, res) => {
  console.log("TELNYX INBOUND:", JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));

  // IMPORTANT: respond immediately
  res.status(200).send("OK");

  // then process async if needed
});


🚨 If you are:

parsing body incorrectly

waiting on DB writes before responding

throwing when event_type ≠ message.received

→ inbound replies will vanish.

🧪 IMMEDIATE TEST (do this now)

Open Render → Logs

Text TEST to 702-867-9664

You should see ANY log hit instantly

If you see nothing:

webhook not reached → routing problem
If you see logs but no UI update:

app logic issue
If you see logs but Telnyx dashboard shows failures:

response status issue

📍 Also CHECK THIS (quick)

In Telnyx:
Programmable Messaging → Debug → Message Events

You should see inbound messages marked:

DELIVERED → RECEIVED

If you see:

FAILED or WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT → webhook response bug

🎯 Bottom line

✔ Campaign approved
✔ Number provisioned
✔ Number attached to profile
✔ Webhook URL correct

❌ Webhook handler is not responding correctly

Next step (important)

Paste your webhook code for /api/webhooks/telnyx here
(or screenshot your Render logs when you text back)

I will tell you exactly what line is breaking inbound SMS.
