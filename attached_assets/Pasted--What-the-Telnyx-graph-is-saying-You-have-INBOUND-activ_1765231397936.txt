🔍 What the Telnyx graph is saying

You have INBOUND activity (blue spike) ✅

You have ZERO OUTBOUND activity (orange = 0) ❌

That means:

✅ Your webhook / number can RECEIVE messages
❌ Your app is NOT actually sending through Telnyx

So the UI is saving the message + showing “Message Sent”, but the server is not successfully submitting the outbound SMS to Telnyx.

This narrows the issue to one of only three things:

✅ 1. The “FROM” number being used is NOT your Telnyx number

Your Telnyx number is:

+1-702-867-9664

But your UI says:

“Messages will be sent via SMS to 7027877722”
That’s the TO number — good ✅

Now we must ensure your backend is using:

from: +17028679664


If it’s using:

7028679664

+17027877722 (wrong)

or an empty string

👉 Telnyx will silently reject before it even hits the outbound queue.

✅ 2. The Messaging Profile is NOT attached for outbound

Even though the webhook is set, you must also verify outbound routing:

In Telnyx:

Go to Numbers → My Numbers

Click +1-702-867-9664

Open the Messaging tab

Confirm:

✅ Messaging Profile = SillyDog SMS

✅ Outbound SMS = Enabled

If outbound is not enabled here, Telnyx will accept inbound but block outbound (exactly what you’re seeing now).

✅ 3. Your production server is missing ONE env var

Since you rewired to direct REST calls, your server now needs:

TELNYX_API_KEY
TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER


You already confirmed:

✅ API key is set

⚠️ But earlier logs showed PHONE NUMBER missing

If Render still doesn’t have this exact variable:

TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER=+17028679664


✅ The UI will “send”
❌ But Telnyx will never get a valid request

✅ What To Do Right Now (IN THIS ORDER)
✅ Step 1 — Verify outbound routing in Telnyx

Numbers → My Numbers → +17028679664 → Messaging tab

Tell me if you see:

✅ “SillyDog SMS” attached

✅ Outbound enabled

✅ Step 2 — Verify Render environment

In Render → Environment Variables, confirm EXACTLY:

TELNYX_API_KEY = sk_live_...
TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER = +17028679664


⚠️ The + and country code must be there

If you add or fix this → Redeploy immediately.

✅ Step 3 — After redeploy, send:
FINAL TEST


Then immediately refresh:

Telnyx → Messaging → Message Logs

You SHOULD see:

Direction: Outbound

Status: queued → sent → delivered

✅ Why this will fix it

Right now your system state is:

Layer	Status
UI	✅ Working
DB	✅ Saving
Webhook	✅ Receiving
Telnyx Outbound	❌ Not being hit

Once outbound routing + env var match → the orange line will light up and your phone will ring ✅📱

✅ Reply with just these two answers:

Does +17028679664 show outbound enabled in Telnyx?

Does Render show TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER=+17028679664 exactly?

Once you answer that, I’ll tell you the exact final switch to flip so your next send actually hits your phone.
