Got it. I checked that exact URL and it is returning 404 Not Found right now. 
Invalid URL

So we need to fix two things:

Use the correct domain (your app is live on Render now, not Replit)

Make sure your server + frontend routing actually serves /review/:token (so it doesn’t 404)

1) Your “new app review link” should NOT be the Replit domain

You’re deployed at Render for the real app, so the correct review link should be:

https://sillydog-app.onrender.com/review/8ddc4b536f670602a42bc88124d10a8f1cf2d5ccc75ff4c5b95a77545030d12e

The Replit link you pasted is a placeholder domain (your-app.replit.app) and will 404 unless you actually own that exact Replit deployment. 
Invalid URL

If you do have a real Replit URL, it will look like:
https://<your-repl-name>.<your-username>.repl.co/... or the new Replit-hosted domain you were given.

2) Fix the “Not Found” page for /review/:token

This is almost always one of these:

A) Your Express server doesn’t have a route for /review/:token

If your app is a React SPA, you need your server to “hand off” that path to the frontend.

Copy/paste this into your server (Express) AFTER your API routes, BEFORE your 404 handler:

// Serve SPA routes that React Router handles (includes /review/:token)
app.get(["/review/*", "/reviews", "/book", "/"], (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "public", "index.html"));
});


If your built file is in dist, then swap to your actual build path (example):

app.get(["/review/*", "/reviews", "/book", "/"], (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "dist", "index.html"));
});

B) React Router is missing the route

In your React routes, you need:

<Route path="/review/:token" element={<ReviewPage />} />


If it’s missing, the SPA loads but shows “Not Found” inside React.

C) Your app is returning server 404 before React ever loads

That happens if you have a generic server 404 handler like:

app.use((req,res)=>res.status(404).send("Not found"));


…and it runs before your SPA fallback route. The fix is simply: move the SPA fallback above the 404 handler.

3) Embed the “Reviews display” on your website + link to “Leave a review”

Best practice:

Website embeds: /reviews (a public page that lists reviews)

Customers submit: /review/:token (unique link per customer/job)

Website embed block (copy/paste)

Use this on your main website:

<section class="section reveal" id="reviews-app">
  <h2>Latest Reviews</h2>
  <p class="lead">Real reviews from real customers.</p>

  <div class="card" style="overflow:hidden">
    <iframe
      title="SillyDog Reviews"
      width="100%"
      height="900"
      loading="lazy"
      style="border:0"
      src="https://sillydog-app.onrender.com/reviews">
    </iframe>
  </div>
</section>


And wherever you want a “Leave a review” button (or in your invoice texts), use the tokenized link:

<a class="btn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
   href="https://sillydog-app.onrender.com/review/8ddc4b536f670602a42bc88124d10a8f1cf2d5ccc75ff4c5b95a77545030d12e">
  Leave a Review
</a>

4) About keeping Housecall Pro reviews after canceling HCP

You can embed them now, but if you cancel, there’s a real risk the hosted review page stops being available later (they don’t clearly guarantee perpetual hosting after cancellation).

Safest plan:

Keep the HCP iframe for now

ALSO start building your own “Testimonials” section (or import your best HCP reviews into your DB/site)

Do this next (fastest way to finish)

Tell me which app is supposed to host reviews:

A) https://sillydog-app.onrender.com (your real app)
or

B) a real Replit URL (paste the exact base domain)

And paste one thing (no guessing):
the code from your server where you define routes (usually server/index.ts or server.js) — just the part where app.use(...) and app.get(...) are set up.

Then I’ll give you the exact final patch to make /review/:token stop 404’ing immediately.
