Would you like me to:


Format this into a developer-ready PDF spec with your logo and colors (for emailing or posting to Replit devs),
or


Generate the actual app project structure in SwiftUI (main files + CloudKit + Stripe setup starter code)?


Either way, I’ll prep it cleanly for handoff or coding.
